# Learning Image Processing
This repo contains a variety of image processing techniques I have been exploring. Feel free to download any files with EXECUTABLE in their title and execute them on any images of your choice to perform their specified image processing technique

# How to Use it
You can download and execute any file with the words "EXECUTABLE" in its title to perform some sort of image processing technique.

You can start by checking the file's help flag for any additional arguments as shown below

```bash
python3 edgeDetectFromFolder.py -h
```
which will help you identify how to use the file as such
```bash
usage: edgeDetectFromFolder.py [-h] --i I

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --i , --images     Path to set of input images
```

then allowing you to use the file to execute
```bash
python3 edgeDetectFromFolder.py --i "/Users/myUser/Desktop/Images to be Edge Detected"
```
