# ImageProcessingPractice
Learning to apply different image processing filters ðŸ“·

This repo contains a variety of image processing techniques I have been exploring. Feel free to download the files and execute them on
any images of your choice to perform the specified image processing technique

# How to Use it
Here's an example use of the edge detection file

```bash
python3 edgeDetectFromFolder.py -h
```
which will help you identify how to use the file as such
```bash
usage: edgeDetectFromFolder.py [-h] --i I

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --i , --images     Path to set of input images
```

then allowing you to use the file as such
```bash
python3 edgeDetectFromFolder.py --i "/Users/myUser/Desktop/Images to be Edge Detected"
```
