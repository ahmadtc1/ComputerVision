# ImageProcessingPractice
Learning to apply different image processing filters ðŸ“·

This repo contains a variety of image processing techniques I have been exploring. Feel free to download the files and execute them on
any images of your choice to perform the specified image processing technique

Here's an example use of the edge detection technique which will perform edge detection on all the images in a folder of your choice
and display the results to you

```bash
python3 edgeDetectFromFolder.py -h
```
