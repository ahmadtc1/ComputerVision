# Learning Computer Vision
This repo contains a variety of computer vision techniques and applications I am in the process of exploring. Feel free to download and run any of the files for some computer vision fun yourself!

# How to Use it
You can download and execute any file with the words "EXECUTABLE" in its title to perform some sort of image processing technique.

You can start by checking the file's help flag for any additional arguments as shown below

```bash
python3 edgeDetectEXECUTABLE.py -h
```
which will help you identify how to use the file as such
```bash
usage: edgeDetectEXECUTABLE.py [-h] --i I

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --i , --images     Path to set of input images
```

then allowing you to use the file to execute
```bash
python3 edgeDetectEXECUTABLE.py --i "/Users/myUser/Desktop/Images to be Edge Detected"
```
